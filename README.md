# DAGAN

This is the implementation code for "DAGAN: Deep De-Aliasing Generative Adversarial Networks for Fast Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction". [Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8233175/)

The code was written by Simiao Yu and Hao Dong.

If you have any questions, please contact Simiao Yu (simiao.yu13@imperial.ac.uk) or Guang Yang (g.yang@imperial.ac.uk).

# Prerequisites

The original code is in python 3.5 under the following dependencies:
1. tensorflow (v1.1.0)
2. tensorlayer (v1.7.2)
3. easydict (v1.6)
4. nibabel (v2.1.0)
5. scikit-image (v0.12.3)

Code tested in Ubuntu 16.04 with Nvidia GPU + CUDA CuDNN.

# How to use the code

1. Prepare data

    1) Data used in this work are publicly available from the MICCAI 2013 grand challenge ([link](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/workshops/)). We refer users to register with the grand challenge organisers to be able to download the data.
    2) Download training and test data respectively into data/MICCAI13_SegChallenge/Training_100 and data/MICCAI13_SegChallenge/Testing_100 (We randomly included 100 T1-weighted MRI datasets for training and 50 datasets for testing)
    3) run 'python data_loader.py'
    4) after running the code, training/validation/testing data should be saved to 'data/MICCAI13_SegChallenge/' in pickle format.

2. Download pretrained VGG16 model

    1) Download 'vgg16_weights.npz' from [this link](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/vgg16/)
    2) Save 'vgg16_weights.npz' into 'trained_model/VGG16'
    
3. Train model
    1) run 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --model MODEL --mask MASK --maskperc MASKPERC' where you should specify MODEL, MASK, MASKPERC respectively:
    - MODEL: choose from 'unet' or 'unet_refine'
    - MASK: choose from 'gaussian1d', 'gaussian2d', 'poisson2d'
    - MASKPERC: choose from '10', '20', '30', '40', '50' (percentage of mask)
 
4. Test trained model
    
    1) (to be finished soon)
